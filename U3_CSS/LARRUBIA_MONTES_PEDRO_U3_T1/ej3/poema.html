<p class="verse">

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<p class="verse">

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
The frumious Bandersnatch!"

</p>
<p>
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br />
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
And stood awhile in thought.

</p>
<p>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
And burbled as it came!

</p>
<p>
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br />
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
He left it dead, and with its head<br />
He went galumphing back.

</p>
<p>
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
O frabjous day!  Callooh!  Callay!'<br />
He chortled in his joy.

</p>
<p>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"It seems very pretty", she said
when she had finished it, "but it’s rather hard to understand!" <br />
(You see she didn’t like to confess even to herself, that she couldn’t make it
out at all.) <br />
